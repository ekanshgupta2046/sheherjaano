# Sheherjaano | Discover cities like never before 🏙️

> **"Dive into Every City. Hear from the ones who live it."**

**Sheherjaano** ("Know your city") is a community-first travel platform designed to bridge the gap between generic travel data and authentic local experiences. It provides a structured space for local contributors to share the true essence of their city—from hidden food spots to cultural history and traditional handicrafts.

## 🎯 The Vision
Modern travel platforms often prioritize high-volume tourist spots, causing travelers to miss the authentic soul of a destination. Sheherjaano empowers residents to share the stories that define their city, helping users go beyond the surface through authentic local perspectives.

* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Node.js / Express (In Development)
* Real-time: WebSockets / Socket.io (Planned)
* Database: MongoDB
* Version Control: Git & GitHub
